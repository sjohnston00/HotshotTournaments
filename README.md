## Configuring Code Formatting

We use [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) to ensure that all our code adheres to the [JavaScript Standard Style](https://standardjs.com/rules.html). To contribute to the project, you'll have to use Prettier and use the [StandardJS Prettier config](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prettier-config-standard). It doesn't matter what editor you use, but we recommend VScode. To setup Prettier, follow these steps:

1. Run `npm i` to install all the projects dependencies, including [prettier-config-standard](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prettier-config-standard)
2. Open *settings.json* by launching the Command Palette (<kbd>⌘</kbd> + <kbd>⇧</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd> on MacOS or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd> on Windows), type *settings.json* and press <kbd>↵</kbd>
3. Add the following key:value pairs to set Prettier as the default formatter:
```json
  "editor.defaultFormatter": "esbenp.prettier-vscode",
  "[javascript]": {
    "editor.defaultFormatter": "esbenp.prettier-vscode"
  }
```

No extra configuration is needed; Prettier is already pointing to the configuration file in package.json. Now you should be able to format an entire document by launching the Command Palette and running Format Document (Forced).
